- An additional analysis was completed to identify current employees eligible for the mentorship program

## Summary:

Large numbers of retirements in a short amount of time can be draining to a company's talent and experience.  In order to minimize the effect of this, experience and knowledge should be passed down as much as possible.  Having employees enroll in a mentorship program is a excellent way to keep the knowedge within the company.  This analysis provides a list of employees that have been identified as being good candidates to learn from the upcoming retirees in their senior rolls.
